-- 0041: close the three ways a signed-in user could take what is not theirs.
--
-- 1. purchase_credit_pack granted a pack's credits with no payment. It stays
--    for the admin to test the credit flow, and refuses everyone else.
-- 2. Every refund function was callable from the browser. The cumulative
--    guard ("refunds never exceed spends for that reason") does not stop a
--    chatbot top-up or a credit gift being refunded while the pool or the
--    recipient keeps the credits. Refunds now happen only through the server,
--    which names the payer; the browser-callable functions are dropped.
-- 3. kb_brains, kb_brain_items, kb_brain_bindings and kb_item_links let any
--    signed-in user insert a row into somebody else's knowledge base as long
--    as the row's owner_id was their own. Chatbots read brains by knowledge
--    base through the service role, so that row would have answered a
--    manager's staff. Insert checks now name the parent as well as the owner,
--    the way 0031 already does for chatbots.
--
-- Safe to re-run. Run through scripts/run-migration.sh or the Supabase
-- migration tooling; do not run by hand in pieces.

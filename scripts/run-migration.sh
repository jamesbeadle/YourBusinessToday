#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs one migration file against the Supabase Postgres database, locally and
# deliberately — the psql equivalent of a hand-run sqlcmd script. Never wire
# this into CI: migrations change customer data and deserve a human at the
# keyboard. The whole file runs in a single transaction and aborts on the
# first error, so a failed migration leaves the database untouched.
#
# Setup (once):
#   brew install libpq && brew link --force libpq   # provides psql on macOS
#   Set SUPABASE_DB_URL in your shell or .env — Supabase Dashboard → Connect →
#   Session pooler connection string (postgresql://postgres...@...:5432/postgres).
#
# Usage:
#   SUPABASE_DB_URL='postgresql://...' ./scripts/run-migration.sh migrations/0001_domain_brain.sql

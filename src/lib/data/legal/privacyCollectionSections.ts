			'Chatbot conversations — the questions members ask, the answers given, which questions went unanswered, and how much of the pool each member has spent.',
			'Client register records — for the businesses we work for: the company, the people named as contacts, the requests they raise, and the threads and builds that follow.',
			'Enquiries — the name, email address, company, website and message you send through the contact page, which create a lead in the client register.',
			'Activity records — credit purchases and spends, shares you create, API tokens and OAuth authorisations you grant, notifications, and the log of what happened in each knowledge base. Card details go directly to Stripe; we never see or store them.',

The lawful basis for this is performing our contract with you.',
			'We rely on our legitimate interests to keep the service secure, to improve it, to reply to enquiries and keep the client register, and to send the emails a business relationship needs. We rely on legal obligation to keep purchase records for tax and accounting law. Where we ask for consent — for anything beyond the above — we will say so at the time and you can withdraw it.',

		paragraphs: [
			'When the service generates something for you — an interview reply, a reading of a document, an answer from a brain, a chatbot answer — the content needed to do it is sent to Anthropic’s Claude API. That is your message or question and the relevant parts of the knowledge base, and for a chatbot it is the member’s question together with the relevant parts of the manager’s knowledge base. Anthropic processes it to produce the answer; it is not used to train models for anyone else.'

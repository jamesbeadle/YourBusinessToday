The record of a project — its requests, threads and attachments — is kept for the life of the engagement and for six years afterwards, because that is how long a question about the work can reasonably arrive.',
			'Enquiries and client register records are kept while we are working with, or still hoping to work with, the business concerned, and are reviewed at least every two years. The records that tax and accounting law requires are kept for six years and no longer. Server logs are kept for no more than thirty days.'
